ofxBlackmagic2
==============

<img src="https://raw.github.com/elliotwoods/ofxBlackmagic2/master/ofxaddons_thumbnail.png" />

This fork of Elliot Woods ofxBlackmagic2 addon for openframeworks has been altered to **work with openframeworks 0.10.x and vs2017** as well as working with the project generator, it no longer adheres to Elliot Wood's addon pattern (sorry, great system, but I neeeded a fast fix) and does not require ofxaddonlib.

Features:

* Uses DeckLink SDK for colour conversion (much faster/more efficient than hand-rolled solutions)
* Designed for use with multiple devices (and devices with multiple inputs, e.g. DeckLink Quad)
* Object oriented with namespaces
* Lockable frames for threading

Alternatives:

* https://github.com/jamezilla/ofxBlackmagic 
* https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxBlackmagic

Installation
------------

This addon has been tested on Windows, but it should also work on OSX and Linux (by including the DeckLink SDK's for those platforms in your project and ignoring DeckLinkAPI_i.c, DeckLinkAPI_i.h).

On Windows, install BlackMagic Desktop Video (not the SDK), then try out an example.

Designed to work with all DeckLink products, e.g.:

* Intensity Pro/Shuttle/Thunderbolt
* DeckLink Quad
* DeckLink SDI
* UltraStudio 4K
* UltraStudio Mini Recorder
* etc

Tested with:

* DeckLink Quad
* Blackmagic Production Camera 4k
* Intensity Pro

Warning
-------

Due to particular type names in DeckLinkAPI.h, ofxBlackMagic.h must be included before ofMain.h (or addons which include ofMain.h) in your ofApp.h (or elsewhere).

Setting up new projects
------------


#### Include Order

ofxBlackmagic2 is a little finicky about the order it is added in, and must be included before everything else in your program.

1. Make sure `ofxBlackMagic2.h` is included above everything else in your `ofApp.h` file (or wherever else you are using it).
    ```
    #pragma once

    #include "ofxBlackmagic.h"
    #include "ofMain.h"

    ...
    ```
2. Make sure `ofApp.h` (or whichever file is including the addon) is included above everything else in your `main.cpp` file.
    ```
    #include "ofApp.h"
    #include "ofMain.h"

    //========================================================================
    int main(){
        ...
    }
    ```
